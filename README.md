# Inventory Management System

A Java-based Inventory Management System developed using NetBeans IDE, following
industry-standard practices such as DAO–POJO architecture, role-based access,
and database-driven operations.

---

##  Overview

This application is designed to manage inventory, employees, receptionists,
and billing operations for a small to medium-scale business.
The system starts with a splash screen and provides secure login access for
Admin and Receptionist roles. Billing functionality is handled exclusively
by the Receptionist module.

## Technology Stack

- Java
- Swing / AWT
- MySQL
- JDBC
- DAO – POJO Architecture
- NetBeans IDE

---

##  Features

- Splash screen on application startup
- Secure login for Admin and Receptionist
- Employee management (Add / Update / Delete)
- Receptionist management
- Product and inventory management
- Stock quantity tracking
- Billing screen for product sales (Receptionist module only)
- Automatic bill calculation

##  System Architecture (DAO–POJO)

The project follows the DAO–POJO design pattern to maintain a clean separation
of concerns.

- POJO classes represent data entities such as Employee, Product, and Bill
- DAO classes handle all database operations using JDBC
- UI layer interacts with DAO classes through POJO objects

This architecture improves maintainability, scalability, and code readability.
